== Data source
- Resources (e.g. buckets, DBaaS, ...) are fetched from Exoscale Provider and K8s Cluster.
- The resource names in Exoscale are unique across organisation which prevents clusters having same resource names.

== Data saving

- The data is saved in a postgres database.
- A database must be provided in the postgres URL.
- The application ensures the initial configuration of specified database in the URL.
