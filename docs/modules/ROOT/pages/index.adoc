= billing-collector-cloudservices

Controller to sync usage data from the Exoscale and Cloudscale metrics APIs to Odoo16

Metrics are collected taking into account product (e.g. `object-storage-storage:exoscale`), source (e.g. `exoscale:namespace`), tenant (organization) and date time.

On DBaaS, we also gather information by Plan. That can be seeing in the product. For example, in the case of a PostgreSQL database service, product may look like `appcat-exoscale-pg-hobbyist-2`.
